Subject: Apology for Not Informing Sick Leave on 10th October

Dear [HR Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to inform you that I was on sick leave on 10th October. I apologize for not sending the leave email on that day.

However, I had informed my manager, Vikas, and our team via [mention mode, e.g., Teams/WhatsApp/email] about my absence. I apologize for any inconvenience caused due to the delay in sending this email.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Employee ID, if applicable]

Agar aap chaho to main isko thoda aur friendly aur short version me bhi bana sakta hoon jo HR ko directly samajh aaye aur formal bhi lage.

Kya main wo version bana doon?
